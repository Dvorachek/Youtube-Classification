Data:
	-> Decide on number of categories => 10?
	-> Which categories => most populated? look at the data and see...

	-> Add 3 datasets together	
	-> Filter the data

Implementation:
	-> load the data
	-> filter out unnecessary strings
	-> other data cleaning...?
	-> balance the data? (depends on how many in each category)
	-> split data into 70/20/10 sets	
	
	-> write each classification algorithm:
		-> try all 5 algorithms:
			-> Find Similar?, Decision Tree, Bayes Nets, Naive Bayes, SVM, 
			-> CNN?



Report:
	-> Add some description of turning strings into usable features.
	-> Add more papers to related work. More research. On text classification?
	-> Update data field to depend on chosen categories...

Others:
	All -> read scikit learn tutorial on text classification
	CNN of thumbnail?
